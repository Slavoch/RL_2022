    "### About Rcognita\n",
    "The platform for this (and all subsequent work) is [Rcognita](https://gitflic.ru/project/aidynamicaction/rcognita), a framework for applying control theory and machine learning algorithms to control problems, an integral part of which is the closed-loop interaction between the agent under control and the environment evolving over time. In the Rcognita paradigm, the main bearer of all the classes and variables needed to run the simulation is the `pipeline`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main parts of `pipeline` are: \n",
    "* `simulator`, which is defined at module `simulators.py` and responsible for simulation of evolution of the environment\n",
    "* `actor`, defined at module `actors.py`, which is responsible for obtaining of action\n",
    "* `critic`, defined at module `critics.py`, which is reponsible for learning of reward function and obtaining its value \n",
    "* `controller`, which is defined at module `controllers.py` and it's needed to put it all together into an RL (or other) controller\n",
    "* `system`, which is defined at module `systems.py`. (Possible variations are ODE or discrete, like our grid world)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other minor things are also declarated in the pipeline and assembled module by module up to the execution of the pipeline itself. \n",
    "Just to be on the same page, we provide some notation to prevent further confusions.\n",
    "* `weights` is the general name and for weights of neural network and for values in tables of value function and policy as well. This agreement comes from the motivation for being consistent with classical RL where critic and actor are being implemented as some neural networks with some **weights**. So, here comes the second term\n",
    "* `model`. It's obvious that parameters give specificity to something. But the general form itself is being called `model`. There are plenty of models of different types and forms (such as NN). Model is what critic and actor and even running cost always have, no matter what.\n",
    "* `predictor` - Inspite of it's cryptic name, this object performs an important function, namely, it carries the law by which the dynamics of our system is being predicted in future. For example, if we have some differential equation\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\dot{\\boldsymbol x} = \\boldsymbol f(\\boldsymbol x, \\boldsymbol u)\\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol y = h(\\boldsymbol x) \\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol x(0)=\\boldsymbol x_{0}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    "in general, there are several ways of prediction: \n",
    "> - **Analytical**, when we have a precise formula of analytical solution $\\boldsymbol x(t)$ to the ODE and have no problems to compute it at any given time. This is great but not that possible in real life. Nevertheless, our predictor could be expressed like:  $\\text{predictor}(\\boldsymbol x(\\tau),dt) = \\boldsymbol x(\\tau + dt)$\n",
    "> - **Numerical** way is mostly a case. The simplest way of prediction then is an Euler method:\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol x_{k+1}= \\text{predictor}(\\boldsymbol x_k, \\delta)=\\boldsymbol x_{k}+\\delta \\boldsymbol f\\left(\\boldsymbol x_{k}, \\boldsymbol u_{k}\\right) \\text {, }$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our current grid world case is discrete** and system looks like $\\boldsymbol x_{k+1} = \\text{predictor}(\\boldsymbol x_{k}, \\boldsymbol u)=\\boldsymbol f(\\boldsymbol x_{k}, \\boldsymbol u)$. So, **predictor** is trivial here and just invokes a state transition rule, which is already implemented in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### About state transition rules\n",
    "So, now we understand, that predictor is something that predicts the resulting state after our action is applied. But what are the rules? Here are:\n",
    "* If the agent in the terminal state, it goes nowhere and doesn't receive reward from any action\n",
    "* If the agent goes out of bounds -> it goes nowhere and just stay on its place and receives reward as usual\n",
    "* All other cases are intuitive:\n",
    "    * `predictor.predict((x, y), 0)` -> `(x + 1, y)`\n",
    "    * `predictor.predict((x, y), 1)` -> `(x - 1, y)`\n",
    "    * `predictor.predict((x, y), 2)` -> `(x, y + 1)`\n",
    "    * `predictor.predict((x, y), 3)` -> `(x, y - 1)`\n",
    "    * `predictor.predict((x, y), 4)` -> `(x, y)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's move on the \"how-to\" part.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"How-to\":\n",
    "* *How to get what i need? Where all classes and variables are stored?* -\n",
    "Since Rconita is created in a modular style, you almost always can see what's going on in a specific module, going hierarchically from the pipeline to right wherever you need. For example, to get the weights of critic model, here you go:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline.critic.model.weights\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or maybe just `critic.model.weights` if `critic` is available as class instance at your scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *How to obtain a prediction correctly?* - \n",
    "prediction of the next state can be obtained the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prediction = self.predictor.predict(observation, action)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In that case predictor will return a tuple with coordinates of the next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `self.discount_factor` - that's how you can obtain $\\gamma$ inside critic and actor\n",
    "* `self.running_objective(observation, action)` - that's how you can obtain a value $r(\\boldsymbol x, \\boldsymbol u)$\n",
    "* *What if i want to use critic inside of actor and vice versa?* - ACTOR IS AWARED OF CRITIC. As critic is awared of actor's model. When you work with actor, you can access **critic's weights** (and vice versa) and objective, don't dublicate your code\n",
    "* A **full list of parameters** explicitly passed into actor and critic can be found in the testing cell. There is an `initialize_actor_critic()` method, where those classes are instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 problems in this assignment in total and many things related to implementation are being behind the scene. Your main objective is to implement 3 algorithms of tables (weights) updating procedure correctly. In case of successful implementation, you will obtain something like that:\n",
